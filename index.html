    Dear Hareem,<br><br>

    My love, my Hareem, my wifey ❤️<br><br>

    I don’t even know where to start, because no amount of words could ever fully explain
    what you mean to me. You are not just someone I love — you are my safe place,
    my happiness, my calm in chaos, and my biggest blessing.<br><br>

    Every time I talk to you, every time I think about you, my heart feels lighter.
    You have this beautiful way of making even the simplest moments feel special.
    Your smile, your laugh, your presence — they all mean more to me than you’ll ever know.<br><br>

    Hareem, you make my world brighter without even trying.
    You motivate me, support me, and believe in me in ways no one else ever has.
    With you, love feels easy, real, and pure.
    You make me want to be better, not just for myself, but for us.<br><br>

    I promise to always choose you.
    To stand by you, to protect your heart, to respect you, and to love you in every way possible.
    Through every high and every low, I want you right next to me — my wifey, my forever,
    my person. 💍❤️<br><br>

    Thank you for being you.
    Thank you for loving me the way you do.
    Thank you for existing, because my life truly feels incomplete without you in it.<br><br>

    Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.
    Today, tomorrow, and always — my heart is yours. 💕🌹
